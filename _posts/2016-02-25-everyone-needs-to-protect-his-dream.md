who haven't got a dream? I just want to start my own company and create a product.
many times I have to consider the money, friends, family and other people's eye
light. It makes me very uncomfortable sometimes. Now I come to the same crossing:
choose a company and do the work I don't like and gain a lot of money or choose the
one I like, gain much less, start to learn coding, managing, cooperation.

this time I will choose the last. I know maybe I will regret. But I have still my
thought sometimes.
